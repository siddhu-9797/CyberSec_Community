          <p>
            Welcome to Enter The Breach (the "Simulation", "Platform", "we",
            "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how HAKTOPUS
            ("Company") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in
            relation to our cybersecurity simulation platform and associated
            services (collectively, the "Services").
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using our Services, you signify that you have read,
            understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and
            disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy
            Policy and our Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect information to provide and improve our Services. The
            types of information we may collect include:
          </p>

          <h3>1.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account Information (if applicable):</strong> If you
              create an account, we may collect your username, email address,
              password (stored securely using hashing), and any other
              information you provide during registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simulation Configuration:</strong> Details you input to
              configure a simulation scenario, such as intensity, duration, or
              specific parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g.,

          <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We may share the information we collect in the following
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information
              with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers
              who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, data
              analysis, email delivery, customer service, and analytics (like
              Microsoft Clarity). These service providers will only have access
              to your information as necessary to perform their functions and
              are contractually obligated to protect your information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Data:</strong> We may share
              aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably
              be used to identify you, for research, benchmarking, or to improve
              our Services. For example, we might share aggregated statistics
              about simulation performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a
              merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization,
              bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of
              service to another provider, your information may be sold or
              transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law
              and/or contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your
              information if required to do so by law or in the good faith
              belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
              obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii)
              act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
              users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
              liability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information
              with third parties when we have your consent to do so.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
            guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will
            do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
            You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We will retain your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no
            ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
            information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is
            not possible (for example, because your personal information has
            been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
            personal information and isolate it from any further processing
            until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For simulation performance data, we may retain this data in an
            aggregated or de-identified form for longer periods for research and
            service improvement purposes.
          </p>

            10. How Fortune 500 Companies Approach Privacy for Similar Platforms
          </h2>
          <p>
            Large organizations, including Fortune 500 companies, that offer
            simulation, training, or interactive platforms typically maintain
            comprehensive privacy policies. Common practices include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Detailed Data Inventories:</strong> Clearly outlining all
              types of data collected, including granular details about
              interaction and performance data within their platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Specific Use Cases:</strong> Explicitly stating how data
              is used for platform improvement, personalization, measuring
              training effectiveness, and potentially for internal talent
              development or assessment (with appropriate consents).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Robust Security Measures:</strong> Highlighting their
              commitment to data security, often referencing industry
              certifications or standards they adhere to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clear Data Sharing & Third-Party Disclosures:</strong>
              Transparently listing categories of third parties with whom data
              might be shared (e.g., LMS providers, analytics partners, cloud
              hosting).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Rights & Control:</strong> Providing clear mechanisms
              for users to exercise their data protection rights, often through
              dedicated privacy portals or dashboards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Role-Based Access:</strong> If the platform is used in an
              enterprise context, they often detail how access to user data is
              managed and restricted based on roles (e.g., employee vs. manager
              vs. administrator).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):</strong> For B2B
              offerings, they provide DPAs to their enterprise customers
              outlining responsibilities under laws like GDPR.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regular Audits & Updates:</strong> Their policies are
              regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in legal
              requirements and business practices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our approach aims to align with these best practices by being
            transparent about our data handling for the "Enter The Breach"
            simulation platform.
          </p>
